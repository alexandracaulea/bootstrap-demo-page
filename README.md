## Recreating [this page](https://www.frontendbootcampdemo.com/) with the help of the Bootstrap docs

Instead of following a tutorial to learn Bootstrap, I am trying a new thing: see the live version of the final project and trying to implement it on my own with the help of the docs.

I've never tried this approach in the past when I wanted to learn a new technology. I either read the docs, followed a course, or built a project from scratch.
